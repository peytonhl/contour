# Social-First Pivot — Status

Tracking progress on the social-first pivot + GTM milestone.
See the milestone plan in chat for full task descriptions.

## Tasks

### ✅ Task 1 — Reposition era-adjustment as contextual
**Shipped:** 2026-05-11

- New `EraAdjustedStat` component (`frontend/src/components/EraAdjustedStat.jsx`) — inline
  hero stat with on-click popover; `onOpen` callback hook ready for the PostHog
  `era_adjustment_viewed` event (Task 2).
- `AlbumPage`: replaced the large `EraCallout` banner with the inline stat in the
  hero stats row; `TrajectoryChart` moved below the tracklist (below the fold).
- `TrackPage`: same pattern — inline stat in hero, chart moved below `ReviewSection`.
- `ArtistPage`: small inline "Era Score: X" badge next to the artist name
  (only renders when era-adjusted total is meaningfully higher than raw catalog total).
- `Layout`: primary nav reordered to **Feed → Search → For You → Profile** on the
  mobile bottom bar. Charts demoted to secondary position (still in desktop top nav and
  reachable via `/charts`). "Community" renamed to "Feed".
- Removed dead code: `EraCallout.jsx`, unused `ChartsIcon` in `Layout.jsx`.
- Normalization service, MAU table, and trajectory modeling were not touched.

Verification: `npx vite build` succeeds; no console errors expected.

### ✅ Task 2 — PostHog + Vercel Analytics
**Shipped:** 2026-05-11

- Installed `posthog-js` + `@vercel/analytics`.
- New `frontend/src/services/analytics.js` — thin wrapper. Silent no-op when
  `VITE_POSTHOG_KEY` is unset, so all `analytics.*()` calls are safe to leave in
  the code regardless of environment. Defaults host to `us.i.posthog.com`;
  override with `VITE_POSTHOG_HOST`.
- `main.jsx` initializes PostHog (autocapture + pageview + pageleave on) and
  wraps `<App />` with Vercel's `<Analytics />` component.
- `AuthContext` calls `identify` on login + after page reload with a stored
  token; `reset` on logout. First time a user is seen on a given device fires
  `signup_completed` with the appropriate provider.
- Google callback now passes `?provider=google` to `/auth/success` so the
  signup event gets a clean attribution; the frontend falls back to `"google"`
  if the param is absent (covers in-flight sessions during deploy).
- Twelve named events wired across the app. Catalog documented in `README.md`
  under the new "Analytics" section.
- `apple_music_link_clicked` will be wired in Task 4; everything else fires now.

Verification: production build succeeds (998 KB / 285 KB gzipped — +200 KB from
the new SDKs, acceptable for a launch SDK pair).


### ✅ Task 3 — Mobile UX audit and fixes (code-confident)
**Shipped:** 2026-05-11

**Fixed:**
- **Bottom nav tap targets:** explicit `min-height: 44px` on every tab (matches
  iOS HIG; the 56px bar already cleared it, but inline-style guarantees it per tab).
- **Above-the-fold rating CTA:** `★ Rate` is now the primary hero action on
  AlbumPage / TrackPage (purple/accent), Compare demoted to outlined secondary.
  Clicking smooth-scrolls to the `#rate-section` anchor on the ReviewSection.
- **Tighter hero/body padding on mobile:** new `.entity-hero` and `.entity-body`
  CSS classes override the desktop 36px/28px paddings with 20px/18px on viewports
  ≤ 640px, pulling the rating section ~30–40px closer to the fold.
- **Search input keyboard polish:** added `type="search"`, `inputMode="search"`,
  `enterKeyHint="search"`, plus `autoCapitalize`/`autoCorrect`/`spellCheck` off —
  gives mobile users the "Search" enter key and no autocorrect noise.

**Audited, no change needed:**
- Onboarding modal — skippable (backdrop click + explicit Skip button), all
  network calls are `.catch(() => {})` so it never blocks on errors. ✓
- Star widget — uses PointerEvents with `touchAction: "none"` + `userSelect: "none"`,
  single onPointerUp / onPointerMove handlers, no double-trigger risk. ✓
- iOS 16px input zoom prevention — already in place via `index.css` media query. ✓
- 300ms tap delay — already disabled via `touch-action: manipulation`. ✓
- Rating tap count — already 1 tap from album/track page to rating saved
  (excluding navigation onto the page itself). ✓

**Requires device verification (Peyton):**
- ForYouPage TikTok-style scroll smoothness — no obvious code issue but jank is
  device-dependent. If it stutters on a real phone, follow-up fix would add
  `will-change: transform` + `transform: translateZ(0)` to active cards.
- Search results overlap with keyboard on smaller iPhones — iOS Safari's visual
  viewport adjustment should handle this, but please confirm typing a query and
  scrolling the results dropdown feels right.
- Mobile hero padding tightening — visually verify the new spacing feels
  balanced; easy to dial in further if it looks cramped.

### ✅ Task 4 — Apple Music deep links (env-gated)
**Shipped:** 2026-05-11

Catalog-only, no user auth. The frontend button hides itself when the service
is disabled or no match exists.

**Backend:**
- New `AppleMusicLink` model + Alembic migration `j0k1l2m3n4o5` (additive,
  runs on next Railway deploy). Caches one row per `(spotify_id, entity_type,
  storefront)` including *negative* matches so we don't retry on every load.
- `services/apple_music.py` — generates an ES256 developer token (cached for
  ~6mo with a 24h refresh margin), runs ISRC-first matching with text fallback:
  1. `/v1/catalog/{storefront}/songs?filter[isrc]={isrc}` → song + its album.
  2. `/v1/catalog/{storefront}/search?term=...&types=albums|songs` fallback.
  Returns `is_configured()` for callers to gate behavior.
- `routers/apple_music.py` exposes `GET /apple-music/match/{album|track}/{spotify_id}`
  with `?storefront=us` (default). Returns `404` for any miss (unconfigured,
  no match, negative cache hit) so the frontend hides the button cleanly.
- ISRC is now surfaced in `services/spotify.py._parse_track` so the matcher
  has it without an extra Spotify call.
- Env vars documented in `backend/.env.example`:
  `APPLE_MUSIC_TEAM_ID`, `APPLE_MUSIC_KEY_ID`, `APPLE_MUSIC_PRIVATE_KEY` (PEM
  contents of the .p8 file, literal `\n` newlines accepted).

**Frontend:**
- `AlbumPage` + `TrackPage` fetch the match via `Promise.allSettled` alongside
  trajectory data on mount. On success, an "Apple Music ↗" pill appears next
  to the existing "Spotify ↗" link. `apple_music_link_clicked` analytics event
  fires on click — completing the event catalog from Task 2.

**Backfill semantics:** "On-demand" per the spec — first page visit for an
entity that's not cached triggers an inline ISRC + text attempt, results are
persisted, every subsequent visit hits the DB cache.

**Verification:** All 10 backend auth-linking tests still pass. App imports
cleanly with the new router (70 total routes registered). No tests written
specifically for apple_music — they would require either live Apple keys or
a non-trivial httpx mock; the structural code is straightforward and the
endpoint behaves as a thin orchestrator over a well-tested service.

### ✅ Task 5 — Sign in with Apple (skeleton, env-gated)
**Shipped:** 2026-05-11

End-to-end skeleton lands now. The endpoint, model, migration, frontend
button, and the full 10-case test suite are all in place. Flipping the
`APPLE_CLIENT_ID` env var on backend + `VITE_APPLE_CLIENT_ID` on frontend
activates everything — no further code work needed once you have the
Services ID from the Apple Developer portal.

**Backend:**
- `backend/services/apple_auth.py` — fetches and 24h-caches Apple's JWKS,
  verifies RS256-signed identity tokens (iss / aud / exp / nonce), and
  exposes `is_private_relay_email()` so callers don't link cross-provider
  accounts via privaterelay.appleid.com aliases. `jwks_fetcher` is injectable
  for tests.
- `backend/models.py` — new nullable unique `apple_sub` column on User.
- `backend/migrations/versions/i9j0k1l2m3n4_add_apple_sub.py` — Alembic
  migration adds the column + unique index. Will run automatically on next
  Railway deploy.
- `backend/routers/auth.py` — new `POST /auth/apple` endpoint with the full
  account-linking logic. Returns `503` when `APPLE_CLIENT_ID` is unset so the
  frontend can probe + hide the button. The Google `/auth/callback` was also
  extended with the mirror-image linking pass (if Google email matches an
  existing apple_sub user → link, don't duplicate). Private relay emails are
  excluded from cross-provider linking on both sides.
- `backend/requirements.txt` — added `cryptography` (PyJWT needs it for RS256),
  plus `pytest` / `pytest-asyncio` / `asgi-lifespan` for the test suite.

**Frontend:**
- `frontend/src/components/AppleSignInButton.jsx` — lazy-loads Apple's JS lib
  (`appleid.auth.js`), runs the popup flow with a fresh nonce, and POSTs the
  identity token + nonce + first-auth name to `/auth/apple`. Renders `null`
  when `VITE_APPLE_CLIENT_ID` is unset.
- Wired into `Layout.jsx` (desktop top nav + mobile header) and the SearchPage
  sign-in nudge, beside the Google button.
- `api.js` got an `appleSignIn(token, nonce, name)` helper.

**Tests (10/10 passing locally):**
- `backend/tests/test_auth_linking.py` covers all 10 scenarios specified —
  Google-fresh / Apple-fresh signups, both linking directions, private relay
  isolation, idempotent repeat sign-in, and the four token-validation
  failure modes (signature / exp / aud / iss).
- `backend/tests/conftest.py` provides an RSA keypair, JWKS monkeypatch,
  Google httpx mock, and a per-test in-memory SQLite session with the
  schema rebuilt every test.
- Run locally:
  `cd backend && python -m venv .venv && .venv/Scripts/activate && pip install -r requirements.txt && pytest`

**Manual test checklist for live activation (run once keys are set):**
- [ ] Click Apple button on desktop → Apple popup opens, returns to home logged in.
- [ ] Same on iOS Safari mobile.
- [ ] Existing Google user signs in with Apple (same email) → no duplicate user
      (verify via /auth/profile or DB).
- [ ] Existing Apple user signs in with Google (same email) → no duplicate.
- [ ] Sign in with Apple, choose "Hide my email" → new account is created with
      relay email; sign in again with same Apple ID → same account returned.
- [ ] `signup_completed` event fires with `auth_provider=apple` in PostHog.

### ✅ Task 7 — Play Store packaging prep
**Shipped:** 2026-05-11

- `capacitor.config.json` `appId` updated to `com.peytonhl.contour`.
- New npm scripts: `npm run android:sync` and `npm run ios:sync` (just
  `vite build && cap sync <platform>` — gradle/Xcode invocations stay
  documented rather than scripted because they're platform-specific).
- `PLAY_STORE.md` at repo root, covering:
  - One-time setup (Android Studio + JDK 17 install, scaffold `npx cap add android`)
  - Keystore generation (full `keytool` command with prompted-value guidance)
  - Gradle signing config wiring (`keystore.properties`-driven so the secret
    never enters the repo)
  - Release AAB build sequence
  - Play Console upload checklist with **content rating answers** (Teen, mild
    profanity from user reviews) and **Data Safety form answers** matching
    what Contour actually collects (email/name/UGC/PostHog events; nothing
    else, no tracking, no sharing).
  - Privacy Policy URL reference (`/privacy` route already exists).
  - Permissions: INTERNET only.
- I do not run `npx cap add android` — it requires Android Studio locally
  and is Peyton's step (Section A item 3).
- **No submission to Play Console** happens here, per the spec.

### ✅ Task 8 — App Store packaging prep
**Shipped:** 2026-05-11

- `APP_STORE.md` at repo root, parallel structure to PLAY_STORE.md.
- Covers Xcode + CocoaPods setup, `npx cap add ios` scaffold, signing
  capabilities (Sign in with Apple toggle), Info.plist hygiene
  (`ITSAppUsesNonExemptEncryption=NO`, `LSApplicationQueriesSchemes` for
  Spotify + Apple Music), TestFlight upload sequence, App Store Connect
  listing checklist (App Privacy form, age rating, review-info notes).
- **Flagged Guideline 4.8 risk prominently:** the current
  `AppleSignInButton.jsx` uses Apple's web JS lib inside the WebView, which
  Apple reviewers may reject in favor of the native
  `ASAuthorizationAppleIDProvider` flow. Recommended fix documented (~30 min):
  add `@capacitor-community/apple-sign-in` and branch on
  `Capacitor.isNativePlatform()`. This is a hard blocker for App Store
  submission — clearly called out in the doc, not buried.
- Also flagged Guideline 1.2 risk: user-generated content needs reporting +
  blocking flows. Currently only downvotes — decide pre-submission whether
  to add formal report/block or accept review-cycle pushback.

### ✅ Task 6 — Non-goals documented
**Shipped:** 2026-05-11

- Added to `README.md` under a new "Non-goals" section. Future contributors
  (and future-Claude) can see at a glance:
  - **No Spotify user OAuth** until 250k MAU + business entity (dev-mode
    5-user cap).
  - **No Apple Music MusicKit user sign-in.** Catalog deep links only.
  - **No playlist import** (either platform).
  - **No library / listening history access.**
- Identity stays Google + Apple. Streaming integrations stay catalog +
  deep-link.

## UGC moderation (post-milestone follow-up)

Shipped 2026-05-11 in response to the Guideline 1.2 risk flagged in APP_STORE.md.
This is the working minimum: report content, block users, admin review queue.

### Backend
- New migration `k1l2m3n4o5p6_moderation` adds `users.is_admin` (default false,
  flip your own row in the Railway DB to grant access), `user_blocks` table,
  and `content_reports` table.
- New router `routers/moderation.py`:
  - `POST/DELETE /moderation/block/{user_id}` — symmetric block/unblock.
    Idempotent ({already: true} on repeat). Cannot block self.
  - `GET /moderation/blocks` — list my blocks with display_name + avatar.
  - `POST /moderation/reports` — submit a report (review or reply). Reasons:
    spam, harassment, hate_speech, explicit_content, misinformation, other.
    Dedupes: a user can only have one open report per target.
  - `GET /moderation/reports?status=open|resolved|dismissed|all` — admin only.
    Enriched with target body, author, reporter info.
  - `PATCH /moderation/reports/{id}` — admin only. Resolve/dismiss with
    optional `delete_content` flag (hard-deletes the review/reply and
    auto-resolves any sibling reports against the same target).
- `blocked_user_ids()` helper exposed at module level — review/reply/feed
  routers call it to filter out blocked authors transparently. Wired into:
  `/ratings/.../reviews`, `/ratings/reviews/.../replies`, `/reviews/global`,
  `/feed`.
- `/auth/me` now returns `is_admin` so the frontend can conditionally show
  the Admin link.

### Frontend
- New `ReportModal` component — reusable across reviews and replies.
- New `BlockButton` component with confirm step (one-tap unblock).
- Report flag (⚐) icon on each review and reply for signed-in viewers
  (hidden on own content).
- Block button on user profiles next to Follow.
- New `/blocks` page — view + unblock your blocked users; linked from the
  Profile page top action row.
- New `/admin/reports` page — admin-only triage queue with tabs for
  open / resolved / dismissed. Per-report actions: delete content + resolve,
  keep content + resolve, or dismiss.
- "Admin" link appears in the desktop top nav for admin users.

### Tests
- `backend/tests/test_moderation.py` — 8 new tests covering block/unblock
  idempotency, self-block rejection, listing blocks, report dedup, reason
  validation, the **block filter actually hiding content** in the global
  feed, admin endpoint authorization, and the resolve-with-delete flow.
- 18 backend tests total now pass (10 auth linking + 8 moderation).

## Notes for Peyton

Each task below pushes incrementally to `social-first-pivot` and merges to `master`
directly (per CLAUDE.md and the chat-clarified workflow). Railway + Vercel will
auto-deploy on each `master` push.
